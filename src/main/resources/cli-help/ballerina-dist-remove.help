NAME
       ballerina-remove - Remove distributions in your local environment

SYNOPSIS
       ballerina dist remove <distribution>
       ballerina dist remove <-a | --all>

DESCRIPTION
       Remove deletes the specified Ballerina distribution from your local environment.

       However, you are not allowed to remove the distribution, which is currently active.

       Here, the "distribution" has two parts: name and version. Following are some sample
            distributions: jballerina-1.1.0, jballerina-1.4.0, nballerina-0.5.0.

       The <-a | --all> flag removes all the Ballerina distributions except the currently
       active one from your local environment.


EXAMPLES
       This command removes the jballerina-1.0.5 version in your local machine.
          $ ballerina dist remove jballerina-1.0.5
       This command removes all the distributions except the currently active one
       in your local machine.
          $ ballerina dist remove -a
